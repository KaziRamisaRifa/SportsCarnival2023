                                    <br>5. First, Three overs are considered a powerplay, and only two fielders allow
                                    fielding outside the 30-yard circle. Additionally, each bowler has allowed
                                    Bowling two overs in each match.
                                    <br>6. Moreover, if the match draws between 2 teams, it will go for super over
                                    cricket. It means each team will play one over. However, who score high in
                                    1 over will be considered a Winner. Even if we don't find a winner through
                                    one super over, the process will continue until we find a winner.
                                    <br>7. The DLS method will be applied if 25% of a match is played and stops due

                                    minimum of five over the game has to be played to find a result from the
                                    game. However, if the game is not played due to unavoidable circumstances,
                                    the teams will divide the points.
                                    <br>8. Umpires will make decisions in any situation, and their decision will be the

                                    universities.
                                    <br>2. The team has to submit a photocopy of the ID card, a photocopy of the
                                    advising slip, and a passport-size photo of each player in the squad.
                                    <br>3. Within Aguest 30, 2023, each team has to submit the squad list of 15 players
                                    with their required documents.
                                    <br>4. A match consists of two 35 minutes halves with a 10-minute rest period in
                                    between.
                                    <br>5. The match referee's call is the Final call. In a match, the Referee acts as a
                                    timekeeper and makes any decisions that may need to be made, such as fouls,
                                    free kicks, throw-ins, penalties, and added-on time at the end of each half.
                                    The Referee may consult the assistant Match referees at any time in the match
                                    regarding a decision.
                                    <br>6. After the group stage, if a game finishes without the results, it will directly
                                    convert into a penalty shootout. In contrast, the Referee operates the shootout
                                    according to the international act.
                                    <br>7. The whole ball must cross the goal line to constitute a goal.
                                    <br>8. For fouls committed, a player could receive either a yellow or red card
                                    depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the Referee's
                                    discretion. The yellow is a warning, and the red card is a dismissal of that
                                    player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off, then
                                    
                                    they cannot be replaced. If a player receives two yellow cards in back-to-
                                    back matches, he will not play in the next match, but it will be dismissed into
                                    
                                    the next round of the tournament, like Quarter, Semi & final.
                                    <br>9. If a ball goes out of play off an opponent on either of the sidelines, then it is
                                    given as a throw-in. It is a goal kick if it goes out of play off an attacking
                                    player on the baseline. If it comes off a defending player, it is a corner kick.
                                    <br>10.The squad limit for each team will be 15, and one manager is mandatory for
                                    each university. The manager will be in direct contact with the organizers.
                                    <br>11.Each team can have a maximum of 9 players (including one goalkeeper,
                                    the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18-yard box), and
                                    a minimum of 6 players are needed to constitute a match.
                                    <br>12.There can be up to three professional players playing in the best nine
                                    for each team. For a 15-man squad, there can be up to four professional
                                    players.
                                    <br>13. Players registered in the BPL and BCL after 2021 will be considered
                                    professionals in the tournament.
                                    14. If any player gets injured and ruled out of the tournament while the
                                    tournament is going on, he can only be replaced with a regular player. For
                                    a win in group stages, 3 points will be awarded to the winning, 1 point for
                                    a draw, and 0 for a loss.
                                    <br>15. The team's presence should be reported to the organizer 10 minutes
                                    before the match.
                                    <br>16. Teams failing to be present in the field on match time will be penalized
                                    through a walkover, i.e., the opposition will get a walkover. If both teams
                                    fail to be present on time, both teams will get 0 points from that match.
                                   <br> 17. Suppose multiple teams finish with the same number of points in the
                                    group stages. In that case, goal difference will be considered, followed by
                                    goals for goals conceded, head-to-head, cards conceive, and penalty
                                    shootout, respectively.
                                    <br>18. For the group stages match ending with no result will be considered a

                                    <br>19. For Knockout stages, a match ending with no results in the expected
                                    time will go directly to penalties, with each team taking five penalties,
                                    after which sudden death will occur.
